    "# Creating Multi-Step AI Agents Using xpander.ai\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks you through building a complex, multi-step AI agent using a streamlined SDK and visual UI, without managing backend infrastructure. Using a real-world example, you’ll see how easy it is to connect tools, manage state, and deploy production-ready agents with minimal setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is xpander.ai?\n",
    "\n",
    "xpander.ai is a Backend-as-a-Service platform for deploying and managing autonomous AI agents, without the overhead of backend infrastructure. It offers built-in memory, tool orchestration, and visual development tools, allowing you to move from prototype to production seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features & Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🧠 **Persistent Memory & State** – Built-in storage for long-term agent context  \n",
    "- 🔧 **Tool Orchestration** – Easily connect prebuilt tools or any API  \n",
    "- 🧪 **Visual Workbench** – Test, trace, and wire tools and prompts without code  \n",
    "- 🚀 **Multi-Channel Triggers** – Run agents from Slack, Webhooks, UIs, and more  \n",
    "- 🔍 **Observability & Tracing** – Inspect tool calls, model decisions, and payloads  \n",
    "- 🔒 **Secure Model Access** – Bring your own keys or use managed models  \n",
    "- ☁️ **Cloud-Native Runtime** – Scale agents reliably in production  \n",
    "- 🔄 **Composable Components** – Reuse tools and logic across agents  \n",
    "- ⚙️ **Zero Infrastructure Setup** – No need to manage queues, DBs, or servers\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, xpander.ai helps you build robust, real-world AI agents quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You’ll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates a multi-agent setup built using xpander.ai. The example focuses on automating a meeting recording workflow, but it's just one possible use case. The framework is flexible, and you're free to build agents tailored to your own tools, data, and business logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you’ll walk through creating a multi-step AI agent that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connects to your Google Calendar to find upcoming meetings  \n",
    "2. Schedules and initiates meeting recordings  \n",
    "3. Checks recorder status and retrieves post-meeting assets (video & transcript)  \n",
    "4. Emails summaries and recordings to you or your team  \n",
    "5. Maintains memory and context across sessions  \n",
    "6. Uses simple Python functions as tools the agent can call directly  \n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how xpander.ai’s SDK and visual Workbench simplify the process of building, testing, and deploying production-grade agents. You'll combine low code and full code approaches with built-in observability and a fully managed runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s dive in and see xpander.ai in action!"
