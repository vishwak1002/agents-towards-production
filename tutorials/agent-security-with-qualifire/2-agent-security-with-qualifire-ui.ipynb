    "# Agent Guardrails with Qualifire 🔥\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks you through integrating Qualifire to add guardrails to an AI agent. We will build a simple chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-4.1 and Streamlit, and then implement protections against prompt injections, unsafe content, hallucinations, and policy breaches using both the Gateway and SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "As AI agents become more sophisticated and widely deployed, ensuring their safe and controlled operation becomes critical. Without proper guardrails, AI agents can be vulnerable to various risks including prompt injections, unsafe content generation, hallucinations, and policy violations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Using Guardrails\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Security**: Protect against prompt injection attacks and unauthorized access\n",
    "- **Content Safety**: Filter and prevent generation of harmful or inappropriate content\n",
    "- **Quality Control**: Reduce hallucinations and ensure factual responses\n",
    "- **Policy Compliance**: Enforce organizational policies and usage guidelines\n",
    "- **Real-time Protection**: Implement guardrails that work during runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gateway Protection**: Implement API-level security controls\n",
    "2. **Content Filtering**: Set up content moderation and safety checks\n",
    "3. **Hallucination Prevention**: Add fact-checking and verification\n",
    "4. **Policy Enforcement**: Configure and apply usage policies\n",
    "\n",
    "ℹ️  If you're interested in seeing how the demo app is created visit the [streamlit tutorial](../agent-with-streamlit-ui/building-chatbot-notebook.ipynb) before proceeding with this tutorial."

    "## Setup: OpenAI API Key\n",
    "\n",
    "To use OpenAI's API, you need to provide your API key so that the library can authenticate. There are a couple of ways to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Option 1 (Recommended)**: Set the API key as an environment variable on your system (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`). This keeps the key out of your code.\n",
    "   - On Linux/Mac: `export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_key_here'` in your terminal\n",
    "   - On Windows: `set OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your_key_here\"` in the Command Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Option 2**: Directly assign the API key in your code (quick for testing, but be careful not to expose your key if you share your code)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll assume you saved your key as an environment variable for safety. It's a best practice to avoid hard-coding secrets.\n",
    "\n",
    "ℹ️ You can use any LLM you'd like. For this tutorial, we'll use OpenAI's GPT-4.1. If you want to read the specific configurations for each LLM, check out the [documentation](https://docs.qualifire.ai?utm=agents-towards-production)."
